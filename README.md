# ArduinoMeter

This is a little app that takes the signal from a light sensor connected to an Arduino and then sends it to a website hosted on Heroku.

## Technologies used:
 * Arduino
 * Raspberry Pi
 * Faye / Websockets
 * Ruby
 * Sinatra
 * Heroku


Feel free to visit http://shrouded-cliffs-5129.herokuapp.com/ to see it.

If the server is running on the Raspberry Pi, you will see a real time readout of the light level in my office at home.
